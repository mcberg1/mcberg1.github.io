                    For my 18th birthday, my parents got me an airsoft gun, since airsoft had been a hobby I wanted to start.
                    However, less than 24 hours after I first went to the field with it, I had to know how it worked.
                    This is where all of my airsoft adventures began.
                    <br>
                    <span class="tab"></span> 
                    This project specifically began with the "HPA engine". This is the common name among airsofters for the main 
                    internal assembly that is responsible for reciprocating, cycling ammunition, and controlling airflow down the barrel.
                    This would be the equivalent of the bolt assembly on a real firearm.

                <p class="col mx-3"><span class="tab"></span> Eventually, I began to want to make a usable clock from
                    these tubes to have
                    in my room. I started a new design to be laser cut in March of 2021. I wanted it to contain an old
                    telephone bell I had, as an alarm,
                    which explains the size of the case. I stained the case with a dark color stain, but quickly
                    realized I was unhappy with how the whole thing looked, and the tubes went back to collecting dust.

            <div class="row post-text mx-3 my-5">
                <p> <span class="tab"></span>
                    Once the summer began during covid, however, the spark reignited, and I began this design for the
                    clock. I started with the idea of having a small, modern, wooden box. Ideally, I would use
                    capacitive touch to interface, and keep the outside clean. This is where my prototyping begins.
                </p>

            <div class="row post-text-img mx-3 my-5 h-25">

                <p class="col mx-3">
                    <span class="tab"></span>
                    I used an arduino mega for easy prototyping of the capacitive touch interface, where I was testing
                    the ability to sense through â…› inch plywood. This, as expected, required an increased sensitivity. I
                    was concerned about sensor overlap, where two pads nearby each other would struggle to differentiate
                    between which one should be active, and I hoped to be able to place them closer to the surface. I
                    was also contemplating how I would mount the conductive pads in the correct position. I though about
                    using the laser cutter for three dimensional operations, with careful raster engraving. Prototyping
                    this showed that I was able to reliably create recesses with this process, in order to be able to
                    mount the pads. Looking back, this could have been done on our CNC mill, though I was not yet
                    experienced with the mill, and I liked the idea of doing it all on the laser cutter.

                <p class="col mx-3"><span class="tab"></span>With this figured out, I started a model of the case in
                    SOLIDWORKS. I began with the top plate, as it would contain the most features. Firstly, I created
                    holes for the tubes to stick through. Next was the buttons, which was simply text to be engraved on
                    the top. For indication of a button press, I decided to put very small holes above each button for
                    an adressable RGB LED to shine through. I put recessed pockets on the underside of the top
                    plate, directly behind the text buttons, for the capactive pads to mount. The rest of the walls were
                    simply rectangles, sized to fit an arduino uno, the driver shield, and an ESP32 inside.
                    <br>
                    <span class="tab"></span>Ideally, I wanted to hide the edge grain of the plywood, and my solution
                    was to miter each plate at 45 degrees, so they'd match up, hiding the edge grain. I did this
                    in the laser cutter, using a jig to hold the parts at the correct angle.
                </p>
            </div>


            <div class="row post-text mx-3 my-5">
                <p> <span class="tab"></span>
                    Internally, the clock contains an ESP32, and an Arduino Uno, as mentioned before. The Arduino Uno is
                    soley used as a driver for the display tubes. I did not use the ESP32 alone, to minimize extra
                    wiring to the shield. The ESP was used to process the capacitive sensors, drive the LEDs, and to get
                    the time from an NTP server, removing the need for a real time clock (RTC) module.
                </p>

            <div class="row post-text-img mx-3 my-5 h-25">

                <p class="col mx-3">
                    <span class="tab"></span>
                    The top plate was iterated a few times before final assembly, to ensure that the capactive touch
                    interface worked correctly. During this time, I also wrote the code for serial communication between
                    the two controllers. I also implemented the NTP server integration on the ESP32. Eventually, the
                    clock was working correctly outside of its case, and it was ready to be fully assembled. The top plate was glued
                    to the sides, leaving only the bottom unattached.
                    I planned to use miniature push pins to anchor the bottom plate, by passing them through the sides,
                    and into the edge grain. This worked well, though made assembly slightly more difficult.

                <p class="col mx-3"><span class="tab"></span> With the electronics all inside, the rest of the work was
                    programming. Features included are an auto shut off timer, to preserve tube life, and five
                    individual alarm times, which can be set and activated using the buttons (I planned to eventually
                    link this to the bell as a separate module).
